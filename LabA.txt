Assignment 1

We paralellized the jackknife function in four different ways, whih in 
each case resulted in improved mean runtime. The benchmark on the given,
unparalellized version took 515.4 ms which can be put in contrast to the 
paralellized versions of jackknife.

a) Paralellizing using par and pseq, resulted in the time 312.1 ms.

b) Paralellizing using rpar and rseq, got the time 394.s ms. Compared with
   parMap it is better. 

c) Paralellizing using Strategies led to the time 380.8 ms.

d) Paralellizing using Par Monad resulted in the time 352.3.

The number of sparks was 56938 where 3 were garbage colledted and 115
fizzled.
